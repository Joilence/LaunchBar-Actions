# LaunchBar Actions

My repository of LaunchBar Actions.

(Since this repo also works as my LaunchBar Actions backup, it also contains actions made by other authors, which I'll list at the end with credits.)

## My Actions

- **Paste as MD Link**

  Inspired by [Bear App](https://bear.app/). Just copy an URL, go to the editor and call the action, then it will paste the link as Markdown `[]()`.
  
- **Toggle HazeOver**
  
  As the name says, toggle [HazeOver](https://hazeover.com/).
  
- **Toggle System Appearance**
  
  Switch between Dark Mode and Light Mode. Using AppleScript from [here](https://www.40tech.com/2018/09/30/use-launchbar-to-toggle-dark-mode-in-mojave/).

- **Restart WiFi**
  
  Modified from the action in [GitHub - BlackwinMin/launchbar-gallery: Original macOS LaunchBar actions by Minja.](https://github.com/BlackwinMin/launchbar-gallery) by @Minja_Lin.
